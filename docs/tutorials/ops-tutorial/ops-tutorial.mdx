# Tutorial for Operations

When you are working in the operations team, your skill set differs drastically
from the skill set of developers. In order to get familiar with the core
concepts of DevOps, this tutorial focuses on the automation part for the
infrastructure, as well as the application deployment and configuration.

This tutorial uses the [Example Voting
App](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app). This provides you
with a ready to use set of containers that you can use to deploy. With this you
don't have to learn how to develop an application. Instead you can further
strengthen and expand the operational skills to play a crucial role in the
DevOps team.
