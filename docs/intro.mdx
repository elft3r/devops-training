# DevOps Resources

DevOps is the idea of bringing two worlds - Developers and IT Operations -
together. Naturally, this brings a lot of learning and adapting with it. Here,
you will find resources to learn, and understand the ideas, benefits and
challenges.

In the article [What is DevOps?](http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/what-is-devops/)
from Damon Edwards, he points out, that to bring DevOps to life, you need to
care about three main topics. This resonates very well with my experience. A lot
of the time people focus on the tooling and forget about the culture and
processes. That's why the structure is also defined with tooling at the end. As
this is the supporting part of the other two and not the main part.
