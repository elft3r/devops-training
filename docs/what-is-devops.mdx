# What is DevOps?

Nowadays, DevOps is used in many different ways and referred to differently by
many people. But, the basic principle, that it combines software development
(Dev) and IT Operations (Ops), is undisputed.

There is a very good Article by Damon Edwards, called [What is
DevOps?](http://dev2ops.org/2010/02/what-is-devops/). Go read his article to get
a better understanding of the context of DevOps. In this article, Damon Edwards,
explains very well the context and also the challenges. He also mentions the
_Wall of Confusion_ that sits between the two worlds.

This _Wall of Confusion_ is the main thing that should be removed when adopting
DevOps. But this wall plays on so many levels (processes, culture, tooling,
...), which is also the hardest part of the whole adaptation process.

So you see, the idea of DevOps is manyfold and can be quite challenging to put
in place. But the theme is to bring before disconnected teams together and work
side by side to overcome the challenges and differences.
