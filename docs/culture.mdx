# Culture

When you bring two groups of people together, the first thing you need to align
is the culture. That's in my opioion also the reason, why a lot of the DevOps
transformations fail. The company just didn't manage to align and establish a
common culture, within which DevOps can thrive.

I have seen many examples of how DevOps failed. Here is a list of some of them:

> Setting up a DevOps Team that purely is made up from developers, without
> anyone from the IT operations teams.

> Special DevOps Teams completly seperated from the development and IT
> operations teams. Which lead to things like "Oh, that's something the DevOps
> Team has to do. That's not my problem."

All the examples lead to still separated teams. But now, instead of having just
two teams: Dev and Ops, a lot of these companies end up with three: Dev, DevOps
and Ops teams, or more teams. Here the problem is not so much the number of
teams, but the separation between the teams.

So the first thing to look at when you get started with DevOps, is to establish
a culture that overcomes this separation. From experience, I can tell that this
is a crucial and also most likely the hardest part. Especially as technical
people have strong opinions about how things should be done. And also because
humans in general need time to adapt to new behaviour.
