# DevOps Training

In my daily work, I work with different companies and help them set up and
define their DevOps processes. I also work with mentees that reach out to me via
[Coding Coach](https://codingcoach.io). Here I learned that all these people I
work with, have the same problems, me included. And that is to understand and
implement DevOps. It's one of these topics in the IT industry that gets bigger
and bigger, the more you learn about it.

The goal of this repository is to show a path and resources that one can use to
learn about DevOps. And also helps me collect all the different resources, that
I keep searching for, again and again, when someone asks me about something, I
already forgot again.
